# Contribute to primecitizens

> **Notice**
> This is our general contribution guidelines for all primecitizens' projects.

## Online Contribution

All kinds of contributions are welcome, including but not limited to following:

- Code, especially testable code.
- Critics, we know we can do dumb things from time to time, thus we would love to hear critics, and the fiercer the better!
- Bug reports, with or without detailed information, we understand not all people are tech-savvy, but please try your best.
- Questions (any kind, but don't ask for personal information).
- Ideas & proposals, no matter great or stupid, don't be shy, how could you know bad ideas cannot give birth to great solutions?
- Insights, visions, advices, suggestions ... etc., with or without practical solutions, we value every piece of human thinking.
- Spelling mistakes (It would be nice if you would say something as a human instead of creating a cold pull request looking like a robot).

General rules to contributors:

- Be anonymous: famous or infamous, the only thing we care about is code quality and project progress.
- Be reasonable: find out and solve the real issue causing the conflict, not to stick with fault of others.
- Be responsible: when contributing, 14 days after no further discussion since the time we have responded your contribution and no consensus was achieved, we may kindly reject your contribution and you need to try next time.

No other rules, but it would be nice of you to be kind to each other ;)

## Offline Contribution

Not really, but in real-life, we value our privacy a lot, and we are steadily losing it thanks to aggressive online/offline tracking/surveillance done by Gov/non-Gov entities and way too many people willingly giving out their personal information without a second thought either for convenience or never bother to care.

**The best way to contribute to this project offline, is to protect your own privacy and defend your freedom together with us.**

Currently you can support us by buying [mullvad service](https://mullvad.net/) for yourself.

After we had released the web extension in Go, which will be able to connect [websocket endpoints from mullvad](https://mullvad.net/en/help/shadowsocks-with-v2ray/) for web browsing, you may donate your anonymous mullvad account to us to protect peasants' privacy and encourage mullvad to provide more websocket endpoints.
